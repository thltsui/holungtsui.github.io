Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Alan, a 3rd year PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at [The University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk) working with [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/), [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/). Trained as a Statistician, I've come to realise the importance mathematics and statistics pose in solving challenges faced in this evolving and challenging data-centric era. This also motivates my research interests: focusing on the intersection of Probabilistic Kernel Methods with various ML domains such as Explainable AI, Statistical Downscaling, Graph Learning, Causal Inference and Ranking. 

I also enjoy applying the latest AI research and data science developments to the industry as a freelance ML consultant. For instance, I have designed the interpretable forecasting model behind [giniPredict](https://www.gini.co), allowing business to access powerful forecasting technology with just a simple Google sheet interface. I also worked with [Crop4Sight](https://crop4sight.com) to deliver a potato crop management software that forecast "saleable" crop yield for better returns. I relish the application of my research in creating value for businesses, and the variety of projects and clients I work with in turn link back into my research, inspiring me with new ideas.  

When I'm not working, you can usually find me at the gym or reading at a local cafe. I also feed my creative side with singing and the playing the guitar. I enjoy trying new things and picking up new hobbies; recently, I passed a brewing exam, so I guess you could add barista to my job title too.
