Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Terence Tsui, a 3rd year PhD student studying stochastic analysis and population genetics at the [Statistics Department of The University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Prof. Alison Etheridge](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/alison-etheridge/). I am also part of the [Mathematics of Random Systems CDT](https://www.randomsystems-cdt.ac.uk/) and a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholars/rhodes-scholars-class-of-2019/terence-tsui-ho-lung/) from Hong Kong.

As a research student, I am mainly interested in how macroscopic phenomena in biological populations (genealogies, population dynamics) emerge from microscopic dynamics at the level of individuals (competition, births, deaths, establishment). To understand this, I often write down individual-based models and characterise their scaling limits as solutions to martingale problems or stochastic partial differential equations. 

Apart from research, I am deeply passionate in addressing educational issues. I have multiple teaching roles within and beyond the University of Oxford and I work hard on educational outreach projects. I co-founded Project Access Hong Kong (now [Access Abroad Hong Kong](https://www.accessabroadhk.org/) )to increase access to overseas study for under-resourced students in my city. I have also promoted scholarship among Hong Kong postgraduate communities through my involvement with [Oxford University Hong Kong Scholars Association](https://oxhkscholars.web.ox.ac.uk/#/).

An avid listener of audio-books and a frequent traveller, I aspire to collect and live out stories to be told to future generations.
