Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me


Iâ€™m Terence Tsui Ho Lung, a postdoctoral researcher at [MaThRad](https://mathrad.ac.uk) working on the interface between mathematics and nuclear engineering. My work utilises the theory of branching particle system and Monte Carlo methods to improve algorithms that simulate radiation transport in the context of reactor design evaluation.

I studied stochastic analysis and population genetics as a DPhil student at the Statistics Department of The University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Alison Etheridge. I was also part of the [Mathematics of Random Systems CDT](https://www.randomsystems-cdt.ac.uk) and a Rhodes Scholar from Hong Kong.

Apart from research, I am deeply passionate in addressing educational issues. I had multiple teaching roles within and beyond the University of Oxford and extensive experience on educational outreach projects. I co-founded Project Access Hong Kong (now [Access Abroad Hong Kong](https://www.accessabroadhk.org)) to increase access to overseas study for under-resourced students in my city. I also promoted scholarship among Hong Kong postgraduate communities through my involvement with Oxford University Hong Kong Scholars Association.
