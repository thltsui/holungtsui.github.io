I am mainly interested in how macroscopic phenomena in biological populations emerge from microscopic dynamics at the level of individuals. In particular, I investigate the following questions:

1) How do interactions at an individual level (e.g. competition, births, deaths, establishment) at different scales affect the overall population dynamics? 

2) How do we measure / describe the effect of biological mechanisms (mutation, selection, recombination, DNA degradation) on the genetic patterns and genealogies within a population?

To understand these questions, I often write down individual-based models and characterise their scaling limits as solutions to martingale problems or stochastic partial differential equations. This characterisation then provides us with further insights. To achieve this step, I employ tools and techniques from analysis and probability theory, including but not limited to random measure theory, superprocesses, convergence theorems to martingale problems, and the theory of conditionally Poisson systems with lookdown representations.

## Lookdown Constructions and the Representation Theorem for Supercritical Superprocesses
### Research Output
  I hosted a reading session on lookdown constructions in the summer of 2020 for two months. This culminated in a series of notes covering numerous topics such as superprocess theory, the Donelly-Kurtz lookdown process, theory of exchangeable particle systems and the Markov Mapping Theorem across an expansive set of literature. This also resulted in a new proof of the Evans--O'Connell representation of supercritical superprocess through a lookdown construction, as well as a computer program that efficiently simulates and visualises the lookdown representation of supercritical superprocesses.

## Uncovering Genealogical Structures from Population with Local Density Regulation
  On-going work with Prof. Alison Etheridge, Prof. Thomas Kurtz, Mr. Ian Letter, Prof. Peter Ralph
### Abstract
  In this working paper, we consider population models in which individuals have separate juvenile and adult phases and density-regulated rates of birth, death and establishment. We want to investigate how different scalings of local density regulation, time, and carrying capacity, results in distinct population limits. We also want to present a lookdown representation for our models which allows us to describe the dynamics of lines of descent. In particular, the incorporation of a juvenile stage in our model is novel which leads to a much wider class of superprocess models which have local regulations on their spatial motions.
