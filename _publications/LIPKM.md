### TL;DR
We challenge the assumption of rankability of duelling data and derive models for inconsistent preferences.

### Abstract
We propose a probabilistic kernel approach for preferential learning from pairwise duelling data using Gaussian Processes. Different from previous methods, we do not impose a total order on the item space, hence can capture more expressive latent preferential structures such as inconsistent preferences and clusters of comparable items. Furthermore, we show the universality of the proposed kernels, i.e. that the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) is dense in the space of skew-symmetric preference functions. To conclude the paper, we provide an extensive set of numerical experiments on simulated and real-world datasets showcasing the competitiveness of our proposed method with state-of-the-art.
