### TL;DR
We extend classical covariate-free spectral ranking methods to incorporate item covariates using kernel methods.

### Abstract
We consider approaches to the classical problem of establishing a statistical ranking on a given set of items from incomplete and noisy pairwise comparisons, and propose spectral algorithms able to leverage available covariate information about the items. We give a comprehensive study of several ways such side information can be useful in spectral ranking. We establish connections of the resulting algorithms to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and associated dependence measures, along with an extension to fair ranking using statistical parity. We present an extensive set of numerical experiments showcasing the competitiveness of the proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art methods.
